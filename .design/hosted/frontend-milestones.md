## Milestone 2: Lit SSR Integration

**Goal:** Integrate @lit-labs/ssr for server-side rendering of Lit components with client-side hydration.

### Deliverables

- [x] **SSR renderer**
   - HTML shell template with hydration script injection
   - Lit component rendering via `@lit-labs/ssr`
   - Initial data serialization (`__SCION_DATA__` script tag)

- [x] **Basic Lit components (server + client)**
   - `<scion-app>` - application shell
   - `<scion-page-home>` - simple home page
   - `<scion-page-404>` - not found page

- [x] **Client hydration**
   - Client entry point (`src/client/main.ts`)
   - Hydration of SSR content
   - Client-side router setup (@vaadin/router)

- [x] **Page routes**
   - `GET /` - home page (SSR)
   - `GET /*` - catch-all for SPA routing

### Test Criteria

| Test | Method | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| SSR home page | `curl localhost:8080/` | HTML with `<scion-app>` content |
| View source | Browser "View Source" | Complete HTML (not empty shell) |
| Hydration | Browser console | No hydration errors |
| Client navigation | Click internal link | Client-side route change (no reload) |
| Initial data | `document.getElementById('__SCION_DATA__')` | JSON with page data |
| 404 page | `curl localhost:8080/nonexistent-page` | 404 page SSR rendered |

### Key Technical Decisions

- Use declarative shadow DOM for SSR (`<template shadowroot="open">`)
- Serialize initial data as JSON in script tag (not inline in HTML)
- Use @vaadin/router for client-side routing (Lit-compatible)

## Milestone 3: Web Awesome Component Library

**Goal:** Integrate Web Awesome component library and establish the UI foundation with theming.

### Deliverables

- [x] **Web Awesome integration**
   - CDN script/style loading (using Shoelace)
   - Theme CSS custom properties
   - Component registration verification

- [x] **Core UI components**
   - `<scion-nav>` - sidebar navigation
   - `<scion-header>` - top header bar

| Theme variables | DevTools | CSS custom properties applied |
| Dark mode | Toggle theme | Colors switch appropriately |
| Responsive | Resize to mobile | Sidebar collapses/hides |
| Navigation | Click nav items | Routes change, active state updates |

### Notes

- Initially load Web Awesome from CDN for simplicity
- Future optimization: bundle locally for offline/faster loads
- Ensure SSR output includes Web Awesome component tags (hydrated client-side)

---

## Milestone 4: Authentication Flow


**Goal:** Implement OAuth authentication with session management.

### Deliverables

- [x] **Session middleware**
   - koa-session configuration
   - Secure cookie settings
   - Session store (in-memory for dev, Redis for prod)

- [x] **OAuth routes**
   - `GET /auth/login/:provider` - initiate OAuth
   - `GET /auth/callback/:provider` - OAuth callback
   - `POST /auth/logout` - clear session
   - `GET /auth/me` - current user info

- [x] **OAuth providers**
   - Google OAuth 2.0 integration
   - GitHub OAuth integration
   - Provider abstraction for future additions

- [x] **Auth middleware**
   - `auth()` middleware for protected routes
   - Redirect to login for unauthenticated requests
   - User context injection into SSR

- [x] **Login UI**
   - `<scion-login-page>` component
   - Provider selection buttons
   - Error handling/display

### Basic authorization
While the Google oauth provides authentication, we will have a simple settings based authorization that for now will simply check the domain of the email address of the logged in user against a list in the settings of AuthorizedDomains

Note: the implementation of this auth flow should not interfer with the use of dev-auth mode.

### Test Criteria

| Test | Method | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Login redirect | Visit protected route | Redirect to `/auth/login` |
| Google OAuth | Click "Login with Google" | Redirect to Google, then callback |
| Session created | After OAuth callback | Session cookie set |
| User in context | Visit protected route | User info available in page |
| Logout | POST /auth/logout | Session cleared, redirect to login |
| Auth/me API | `curl /auth/me` with session | User JSON returned |
| Invalid session | Expired/tampered cookie | Redirect to login |

### Configuration Required

```bash
# Environment variables for testing
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
SESSION_SECRET=dev-secret-min-32-chars-long
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Milestone 5: Hub API Proxy

**Goal:** Proxy requests to the Hub API with authentication header injection.

### Deliverables

- [x] **API proxy middleware**
   - Route `/api/*` to Hub API
   - Forward authentication headers
   - Request/response logging
   - Error transformation

- [x] **Hub client service**
   - Typed API client for server-side calls
   - Request timeout handling
   - Retry logic with backoff

- [ ] **SSR data fetching**
   - Fetch data during SSR for initial render
   - Pass data to Lit components
   - Error boundary for failed fetches

- [ ] **Mock Hub API (for testing)**
   - Standalone mock server
   - Fixtures for common responses
   - Configurable via environment

### Test Criteria

| Test | Method | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Proxy request | `curl /api/groves` (authenticated) | Hub API response |
| Auth forwarding | Check Hub logs | Authorization header present |
| Timeout | Slow Hub response | 504 after timeout |
| Hub down | Stop Hub | 502 Bad Gateway |
| Rate limit headers | Response headers | X-RateLimit-* forwarded |
| SSR with data | Visit `/groves` | Page renders with grove list |
| Mock mode | `HUB_MOCK=true npm run dev` | Mock data returned |

### Mock Server

Create a simple mock for development without a real Hub:

```typescript
// tools/mock-hub/index.ts
// Serves static JSON responses for Hub API endpoints
```

### Implementation Notes

- **API Proxy** (`src/server/routes/api.ts`): Full implementation with auth header forwarding, debug logging, error transformation, and query string passthrough
- **Dev Token Injection**: When `DEV_AUTH=true`, the proxy injects a dev token for local Hub authentication
- **SSR Data Fetching**: Deferred to client-side in current implementation; pages fetch data on mount rather than during SSR

---

## Milestone 6: Grove & Agent Pages

**Goal:** Implement the core pages for viewing and managing groves and agents.

### Deliverables

- [x] **Grove pages**
   - [x] `<scion-grove-list>` - list all groves with filtering
   - [x] `<scion-grove-detail>` - single grove view with agent list
   - [x] Grove card component with status summary

- [x] **Agent pages**
   - [x] `<scion-agent-list>` - agents within a grove
   - [x] `<scion-agent-detail>` - single agent view
   - [x] Agent card component with status, actions

- [x] **Action handlers**
   - [x] Start/stop agent buttons (wired to API)
   - [x] Delete agent with confirmation
   - [ ] Create agent dialog (basic) - deferred to M10

- [x] **State management (client) — basic**
   - [x] Basic client-side state in components
   - [ ] State manager class — deferred to M8 (requires SSE infrastructure)
   - [ ] Hydration from SSR data — deferred to M8
   - [ ] Optimistic updates — deferred to M8

### Test Criteria

| Test | Method | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Grove list loads | Visit `/groves` | Groves displayed from Hub API |
| Grove detail | Click grove | Navigate to grove detail page |
| Agent list | Visit grove detail | Agents listed for that grove |
| Agent status | View agent card | Correct status badge color |
| Stop agent | Click "Stop" button | API call, status updates |
| Start agent | Click "Start" button | API call, status updates |
| Delete agent | Click "Delete", confirm | Agent removed from list |
| Empty state | Grove with no agents | "No agents" message |
| Loading state | Slow API | Loading spinner shown |
| Error state | API error | Error message displayed |

### Routes

| Route | Page | SSR Data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `/groves` | Grove list | All groves |
| `/groves/:groveId` | Grove detail | Grove + agents |
| `/agents/:agentId` | Agent detail | Agent |

### Implementation Notes

- **Grove List** (`src/components/pages/groves.ts`): Fetches from `/api/groves` on mount, displays cards with status badges
- **Grove Detail** (`src/components/pages/grove-detail.ts`): Fetches grove and agents in parallel, displays grove info, stats, and agent cards with actions
- **Agent List** (`src/components/pages/agents.ts`): Fetches from `/api/agents` on mount, shows agent cards with wired action buttons (Start/Stop/Delete)
- **Agent Detail** (`src/components/pages/agent-detail.ts`): Fetches agent and grove info, displays detailed agent information with quick actions
- **Status Badges**: Uses Shoelace badge variants mapped from API status strings
- **Action Handlers**: Start/Stop/Delete wired to Hub API via POST/DELETE requests with loading states
- **Routing**: SSR renderer handles `/groves/:groveId` and `/agents/:agentId` routes
- **Deferred Work**: State manager class, SSR data hydration, and optimistic updates moved to M8 (Client Real-Time State Management). Agent creation dialog deferred to M10.

---

## Milestone 7: SSE + NATS Server Infrastructure

**Goal:** Implement the server-side infrastructure for real-time updates: NATS client, SSE Manager, and the `/events` endpoint with query-parameter-based subscriptions (WatchRequest pattern). See `web-frontend-design.md` §12 for the full architectural rationale.

This milestone is **server-side only**. The client SSE handler and state management follow in M8.

### Design Context

State updates use SSE (not WebSocket) because the data flow is server-to-client unidirectional. SSE maps directly to a future gRPC server-streaming RPC (`WatchRequest`/`WatchEvent`). WebSocket is reserved for terminal PTY binary data only (M9). See `web-frontend-design.md` §12.1 for the transport design rationale.

### Deliverables

- [ ] **NATS client**
   - Connection management with automatic reconnection
   - Subject subscription with wildcard support (`>`, `*`)
   - Message deserialization (JSON payloads)
   - Graceful drain on shutdown

- [ ] **SSE Manager**
   - Connection-scoped subscriptions (declared at creation, immutable for lifetime)
   - NATS-to-SSE message bridging
   - Sequential event ID tracking for resume support
   - Heartbeat messages (30s interval)
   - Connection cleanup on client disconnect

- [ ] **SSE endpoint (`GET /events?sub=...`)**
   - Query-parameter-based subject declaration (WatchRequest pattern)
   - Multiple `sub` params supported: `?sub=grove.abc.>&sub=agent.xyz.>`
   - Permission validation per subject (`canSubscribe`)
   - `Last-Event-ID` header support for reconnection resume
   - SSE response headers (`Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`, `X-Accel-Buffering`)
   - 400 for missing subjects, 403 for unauthorized subjects

- [ ] **Subject permission model**
   - `grove.*.summary` allowed for all authenticated users
   - `grove.{groveId}.>` requires grove access
   - `agent.{agentId}.>` requires agent access
   - Reject overly broad wildcard patterns

### Test Criteria

| Test | Method | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| SSE connects | `curl -N "/events?sub=grove.abc.>"` | SSE stream opens, `connected` event received |
| Missing subjects | `curl "/events"` (no `sub` param) | 400 error |
| Unauthorized subject | Subscribe to grove user lacks access to | 403 error |
| NATS → SSE flow | `nats pub grove.abc.agent.status '...'` | Event appears in SSE stream |
| Heartbeat | Hold SSE connection open 30s+ | Heartbeat event received |
| Reconnect resume | Reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` header | Events resume from last ID |
| Multiple subjects | `curl "/events?sub=grove.abc.>&sub=agent.xyz.>"` | Events from both subject trees received |
| Connection cleanup | Close SSE client | NATS subscriptions removed (server logs) |
| NATS reconnection | Kill NATS, restart | Server reconnects, SSE continues |

### NATS Testing

```bash
# Start NATS for local development
docker run -p 4222:4222 nats:latest

# Test SSE endpoint (authenticated session required)
curl -N -H "Cookie: scion_sess=..." \
  "http://localhost:8080/events?sub=grove.test.>"

# Publish test messages (in another terminal)
# Lightweight event (grove-scoped, received by grove subscribers)
nats pub grove.test.agent.status \
  '{"agentId":"agent1","status":"running","sessionStatus":"idle"}'

# Medium event (grove-scoped)
nats pub grove.test.agent.created \
  '{"agentId":"agent2","name":"new-agent","template":"claude","status":"provisioning"}'

# Heavy event (agent-scoped only, NOT received by grove subscribers)
nats pub agent.agent1.event \
  '{"type":"tool_use","data":"heavy harness output payload..."}'
```

### Key Technical Notes

- **No `POST /subscribe` endpoint.** Subscriptions are declared via query parameters at connection time and are immutable. To change subscriptions, the client closes the connection and opens a new one. This keeps the server stateless per-connection and maps directly to a future gRPC `WatchRequest`.
- **Event weight classes** are enforced on the Hub publishing side. The SSE endpoint does not filter by weight — the subject hierarchy itself controls which events reach which subscribers. Grove-scoped subjects only carry lightweight/medium events; heavy events are only on agent-scoped subjects (see `web-frontend-design.md` §12.2).

---

## Milestone 8: Client Real-Time State Management

**Goal:** Implement the client-side SSE handler, view-scoped state management, and wire existing pages to receive real-time updates. This completes the deferred state management items from M6.

### Design Context

The StateManager uses **view-scoped subscriptions**: the subscription scope follows navigation, not individual entities. A paginated list of 200 agents uses one grove-level subscription, not 200 agent-level subscriptions. Pagination is a rendering concern; the full state map is maintained in memory. See `web-frontend-design.md` §12.2 for the subscription model and §4.4 for the StateManager design.

### Deliverables

- [ ] **SSE Client class**
   - `connect(subjects: string[])` — builds URL with query params, opens `EventSource`
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - `EventSource` `Last-Event-ID` resume on reconnect
   - `disconnect()` for clean teardown

- [ ] **StateManager with view scoping**
   - `ViewScope` type: `dashboard`, `grove`, `agent-detail`
   - `setScope(scope)` — maps scope to NATS subjects, closes/reopens SSE connection
   - Full in-memory state map (agents, groves) maintained regardless of pagination
   - Delta merging for `update` events (status, created, deleted)
   - Event dispatch for component reactivity (`agents-updated`, `groves-updated`)

- [ ] **View-scoped subscription lifecycle**
   - `setScope()` called on navigation events via router integration
   - Subscription transitions:
     - `/groves` → `sub=grove.*.summary`
     - `/groves/:id` → `sub=grove.{id}.>`
     - `/agents/:id` → `sub=grove.{groveId}.>&sub=agent.{id}.>`
   - SSE connection closed and reopened on each navigation (not mutated in-band)
   - Clean disconnect on page unload

- [ ] **Hydration from SSR data** (deferred from M6)
   - Parse `__SCION_DATA__` script tag into StateManager on page load
   - SSE connection opened after hydration (deltas applied on top of snapshot)

- [ ] **Component wiring**
   - Grove list page receives live grove summary updates
   - Agent list page receives live agent status updates within grove
   - Agent detail page receives full event stream
   - Status badges update in real-time without page refresh
   - Agent created/deleted events add/remove items from lists

### Test Criteria

| Test | Method | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| SSE connects on load | Browser Network tab | EventSource connection to `/events?sub=...` |
| Subjects match view | Navigate to grove detail | `sub=grove.{id}.>` in SSE URL |
| Sub change on nav | Navigate grove → agent detail | Old SSE closes, new SSE opens with agent subject added |
| Agent status update | Change agent status via CLI/API | Status badge updates without refresh |
| Agent created | Create agent via CLI | Agent appears in grove's agent list |
| Agent deleted | Delete agent via CLI | Agent removed from list |
| Reconnection | Kill/restart server briefly | SSE reconnects, state consistent |
| Multiple tabs | Open same grove in 2 tabs | Both tabs receive updates |
| Hydration | View source, then interact | SSR data loaded into state, SSE deltas applied on top |
| Pagination unaffected | Page through agent list | All agents maintain live state, no subscription churn |
| No entity-level subs | Open agent list with 50 agents | Single grove-level SSE connection, not 50 |

### Key Technical Notes

- **Optimistic updates** (immediate UI feedback on action before SSE confirms) are not required for initial M8 delivery. They can be added incrementally once the SSE pipeline is proven stable.
- **The StateManager is a singleton**, accessed via import. Components do not instantiate their own state managers.
- **Pagination does not affect subscriptions.** The grove-level subscription covers all agents in the grove. The component renders the current page slice from the full state map.

**Key parallelization opportunity:** M7 (NATS server infrastructure) depends only on M4 (auth), not on M5/M6. It can be developed in parallel with M5 and M6. M8 then merges both paths — it requires the pages from M6 and the SSE endpoint from M7.

| Milestone | Depends On | Can Parallelize With |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| M1: Koa Foundation | - | - |
| M2: Lit SSR | M1 | - |
| M3: Web Awesome | M2 | - |
| M4: Authentication | M3 | - |
| M5: Hub API Proxy | M4 | M7 |
| M6: Grove & Agent Pages | M5 | M7 |
| M7: SSE + NATS Server | M4 | M5, M6 |
| M8: Client State Mgmt | M6, M7 | M10-M15 |
| M9: Terminal | M8 | M10-M15 |
| M10: Agent Creation | M6 | M7-M9, M11-M15 |
| M11: Template Management | M6 | M7-M10, M12-M15 |
| M12: User & Group Mgmt | M6 | M7-M11, M14-M15 |
| M13: Permissions & Policy | M12 | M7-M11, M14-M15 |

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests (Lit)
- Middleware tests (Koa)
- Service tests (Hub client, NATS client, SSE Manager)

### Integration Tests
- API proxy end-to-end
- SSE endpoint: NATS publish → SSE event received (M7)
- View-scoped subscription lifecycle: navigation → SSE reconnection with correct subjects (M8)
- OAuth flow with mock provider

### E2E Tests
- Full user flows (login → create agent → terminal)
- Real-time update flow (change agent status via API → verify UI updates without refresh)
- Playwright or Cypress
- Run against staging environment

### Manual Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
